Note that this is the same as saying - you are given two functions, are there any values of \\(x\\) where the value of the function is the same?

**b.** Yet another way of looking at these problems is the following - plot the graph of the two functions, and find any intersection points between them. So, plot a rough sketch graph of the *corresponding function* represented by the LHS of the equation, and also the graph of the *corresponding function* represented by the RHS of the equation, and highlight the points of intersection of the graphs, which are also the solutions of the

## C. Solving inequalities

### I. Linear inequality

**a.** Solve the inequalities given below to find the set of values of \\( x\\) for which the inequality hods true.

**b.** Plot a rough sketch graph of the function represented by the LHS of the inequality and mark out the interval(s) of x values for which the inequality is satisfied.

1. \\( 2x - 3 < 7 \\)

2. \\( 3x + 10 \geq 1 \\) 

1. \\( 2x + 1 \geq 3 - x \\)

2. \\( -2x + 5 \geq -6 \\) 

2. \\( -4(x - 2) < 8 \\)

Remember that when you multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, then the inequality reverses. For e.g., if \\( -x < 3 \\), if we multiple both sides by -1, we also need to reves the inequality, i.e. \\( x > -3 \\). Check and confirm for yourself that this is correct.

1. \\( (x - 3)(x + 2) \geq 0 \\)

2. \\( x^2 - 11x + 24 < 0 \\)

2. \\( 12x \leq x^2 + 35 \\)

### III. Inequality with modulus #1

**a.** Solve the inequalities given below to find the set of values of \\( x\\) for which the inequality hods true.

1. \\( |2x - 3| < 7 \\)

1. \\( |3x + 10| \geq 1 \\)

1. \\( |4 - 5x| \leq 9 \\)

Note that these are the same functions from **C.I.1** above, except with a modulus. 

### IV. Inequality with modulus #2

**a.** Solve the inequalities given below to find the set of values of \\( x\\) for which the inequality hods true.

1. Sketch the graph of the function \\( y = (x + 1)^2(2 - x) \\) and solve the following:

* \\( (x+1)^2(2 - x) \geq 1 \\)
