Having explored exponentials in great detail, we are now in a position to explore the world of Logarithms. Lets begin with the definition.

{{< highlight-box "Defn 1:" "none" "" "part" >}}
The **logarithm** of a given number \\( x\\) to a fixed number called a base, say \\(b\\), is the **exponent** to which the fixed number \\( b\\) must be raised to produce the given number \\(x\\), i.e.

$$ y = \log_b (x) \iff x = b^y $$

under the following conditions - \\( b > 0, b \neq 1 \text{, and } x > 0 \\)
