## A. Range of a quadratic

The quadratic functions below are all defined over the domain \\( \R \\) and co-domain \\( \R \\). Do the following for each of them:

**a.** Express the quadratic function in the form \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\).  

**b.** Plot a rough sketch graph of the function, make sure to mark the point where the graph attains a maximum / minimum value.  

**c.** Find the range of the quadratic function  

1. \\( y = x^2 + 4x - 17 \\)

2. \\( y = x^2 + 5x + 6 \\)

3. \\( y = x^2 - 3x + 4 \\)

## B. Solving equations

### I. By completing the square

**a**. For each of the quadratic equations below, complete the square for the quadratic expression in the LHS of the equation, and then find the solution.  

**b**. Plot a rough sketch graph of the *corresponding quadratic function* represented by the LHS of the equation, make sure to mark the point where the graph attains a maximum / minimum value, and also the points where the graph cuts the x-axis, i.e. the roots of the function or the solution to the equation.  

1. \\( x^2 - 10x - 11 = 0 \\)

2. \\( 4x^2 + 8x + 1 = 0\\)

3. \\( 8x - 6 -2x^2 = 0 \\)

4. \\( 2x^2 -8x + 10 = 0 \\)

### II. By factorization

**a.** For each of the quadratic equations below, solve the equation by factorization. 

**b.** Plot a rough sketch graph of the *corresponding quadratic function* represented by the LHS of the equation, make sure to mark the points where the graph cuts the x-axis, i.e. the roots of the function or the solution to the equation.

1. \\( x^2 + 5x -14 = 0 \\)

2. \\( 2x^2 - x - 15 = 0\\)

3. \\( 5x^2 + 9x + 4 = 0 \\)

**b.** Relate the number of solutions of the equation to the sign of the discriminant (\\( \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \\)) in the formula.

**c.** Plot a rough sketch graph of the *corresponding quadratic function* represented by the LHS of the equation, make sure to mark the points where the graph cuts the x-axis, i.e. the roots of the function or the solution to the equation.

2. \\( x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0\\)

2. \\( x^2 - 3x + 15 = 0\\)

2. \\( -3x^2 + 2x + 7 = 0\\)

1. \\( |x| = 10\\)

2. \\( |2x - 5| = 11\\)

3. \\( |x^2 - 2x - 15| = 10\\)

3. \\( |x^2 - 2x - 15| = 16\\)

3. \\( |x^2 - 2x - 15| = 20\\)

3. \\( |x^2 - 2x - 15| = 0\\)

3. \\( |x^2 - 2x - 15| = -10\\)

3. \\( |1 - 4x - 2x^2| = 4\\)

### V. More modulus equations

**a.** For each of the equations below, solve the equation using any method.

**b.** Plot a rough sketch graph of the *corresponding function* represented by the LHS of the equation, and also the graph of the *corresponding function* represented by the RHS of the equation, and highlight the points of intersection of the graphs, which are also the solutions of the equation.

1. \\( |2x - 1| = |x|\\)

1. \\( |2x - 1| = |2x - 3|\\)

2. \\( |3x - 2| = |2x + 5|\\)

3. \\( |2x^2 - 2x - 15| = |1 - 4x - 2x^2| \\)

### VI. Simultaneuous equations

**a.** Solve the following simultaneous equations. 

Note that this is the same as saying - you are given two functions, are there any values of \\(x\\) where the value of the function is the same?

**b.** Yet another way of looking at these problems is the following - plot the graph of the two functions, and find any intersection points between them. So, plot a rough sketch graph of the *corresponding function* represented by the LHS of the equation, and also the graph of the *corresponding function* represented by the RHS of the equation, and highlight the points of intersection of the graphs, which are also the solutions of the
equation.

1. \\( 5x + 2y = 25\\)   
\\( 2x - y = 1\\) 

2. \\( 8x + 3y = 7 \\)   
\\( 3x + 5y = -9 \\)

2. \\( 3x + y = 10 \\)   
\\( 2y = 15 - 6x \\)

2. \\( 2x + 5 = 3y \\)   
\\( 10 - 6y = -4x \\)

### VII. Linear and non-linear

Solve the following simultaneous equations by substituting one in the other.

1. \\( y = x^2 \\)   
\\( y = x + 6 \\)

2. \\( y = x - 1 \\)   
\\( x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\)

2. \\( xy = 2 \\)   
\\( x + y = 3 \\)

2. \\( 3 + x + xy = 0 \\)   
\\( 2x + 5y = 8 \\)
