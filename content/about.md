We are a small group of education enthusiasts. We believe that education should be freely and widely available. We like to see advanced Math and Science and such topics explained in simple ways so that larger and larger audience can enjoy the beauty of the discoveries in these areas. That may well be the solution to many of the social, political, religious ills that we face.

The name of this site comes from a conviction in logic. We think that if logic and reason can drive day-to-day actions of humans, and the interactions between humans, we would have a different world altogether. A bit Vulcanistic, one could say. 

Not to undermine the role of emotions, they have their place in the scheme of things. To be able to cry is a miracle of nature, and to see that the tears while evoking such intense emotions also serve to clean up our eyes is simply fascinating. But we like our logic pure and served neat.

The origins of the name is in a quote by the Buddha - "All that we are is the result of what we have thought. The mind is everything. What we think we become."
