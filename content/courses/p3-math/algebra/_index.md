The Syllabus for this topic is [here](SYL1-Algebra.pdf).

The Scheme of Work for this topic is [here](SOW1-Algebra.pdf). 

Note that the concept of functions is fundamental to almost everything we will learn in this course, and in Math in general. So, we will first do a revision of [this topic](P1-Functions.png) from P1.

Session notes for this topic follow:

* Revision of Functions:
  * Notes on [Sets]({{< ref "sets" >}})
  * Notes on [Mappings]({{< ref "mappings" >}})
  * Notes on [Functions]({{< ref "functions" >}})
  * Notes on [Composition of Functions]({{< ref "composite-functions" >}})
  * Notes on [Inverse of a Function]({{< ref "inverse-function" >}})
  * Notes on [Graph of a Function]({{< ref "exploring-graphs" >}})
* Algebra topics:
  * Notes on [Modulus function]({{< ref "modulus-function" >}})
  * Notes on [Polynomial Basics]({{< ref "basics" >}}) and [Factor and Remainder theorem]({{< ref "polynomial-arithmetic" >}})
  * Notes on [Partial Fractions](https://slides.com/anandjanakiraman/p1-y20-c7-ce1-differentiation-maxima-minima-concepts/fullscreen)
  * Notes on [Binomial Theorem]({{< ref "binomial-theorem" >}}), followed by the case of \\( (1+x)^n \\) for \\( |x| < 1\\).
