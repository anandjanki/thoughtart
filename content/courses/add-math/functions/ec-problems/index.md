EC problems may not always be easy problems. They are actually *extra-curricular* problems.. :) They usually add some interesting facets to the topic under discussion, some fascinating discoveries, etc. But they are usually not from the board syllabus for the topic. (As always, once you read a problem, take some time to attempt it yourself, if you need help, take a peek at the "Hint" section, then again attempt to solve it yourself, feel free to check the "Answer" section if you want to check the answer you found, or even just get a feel for the magnitude of the answer.)

## How many functions?

## How many bijective functions?

**Q.** Given a set A with m elements, and a set B with n elements, how many different bijective (1-to-1 and onto) functions are possible from set A to set B?

## Find the function

**Q.** Find the function \\( f\\) that satisfies \\( f(1) = 2 \\) and the following:
$$ 2\cdot f(x\cdot y) = [f(x)]^y + [f(y)]^x \qquad \forall x, y \in \R $$
