EC problems may not always be easy problems. They are actually *extra-curricular* problems.. :) They usually add some interesting facets to the topic under discussion, some fascinating discoveries, etc. But they are usually not from the board syllabus for the topic. (As always, once you read a problem, take some time to attempt it yourself, if you need help, take a peek at the "Hint" section, then again attempt to solve it yourself, feel free to check the "Answer" section if you want to check the answer you found, or even just get a feel for the magnitude of the answer.)

## How many Sets?

This question is from the US Junior Math Olympiad paper of 2019.

**Q.** Let \\(n\\) be a nonnegative integer. Determine the number of ways that one can choose \\((n+1)^2\\) sets \\(S_{i,j} \subseteq \lbrace1,2,\ldots,2n\rbrace\\), for integers \\(i,j\\) with \\(0 \le i,j \le n\\) such that:

- for all \\(0 \le i,j \le n\\),   
$$ |S_{i,j}| = i+j $$
- and whenever \\(0 \le i \le k \le n\\) and \\(0 \le j \le l \le n\\),
{{< katex >}} S_{i,j} \subseteq S_{k,l} {{< /katex >}}

## Composite functions

This is another question from the US Junior Math Olympiad paper of 2019.

**Q.** Let \\( \Z\\) be the set of all integers. Find all pairs of integers \\((a,b)\\) for which there exist functions \\(f:\mathbb Z\rightarrow\mathbb Z\\) and \\(g:\mathbb Z\rightarrow\mathbb Z\\) satisfying $$f(g(x))=x+a\quad\text{and}\quad g(f(x))=x+b$$
