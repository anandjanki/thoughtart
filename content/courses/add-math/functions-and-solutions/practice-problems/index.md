## A. Range of a quadratic

The quadratic functions below are all defined over the domain \\( \R \\) and co-domain \\( \R \\). Do the following for each of them:

**a.** Express the quadratic function in the form \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\).  

**b.** Plot a rough sketch graph of the function, make sure to mark the point where the graph attains a maximum / minimum value.  

**c.** Find the range of the quadratic function  

1. \\( y = x^2 + 4x - 17 \\)

2. \\( y = x^2 + 5x + 6 \\)

3. \\( y = x^2 - 3x + 4 \\)

4. \\( y = 2x^2 - 3x + 5 \\)
