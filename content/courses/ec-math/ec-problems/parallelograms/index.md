EC problems may not always be easy problems. They are actually *extra-curricular* problems.. :) They usually add some interesting facets to the topic under discussion, some fascinating discoveries, etc. But they are usually not from the board syllabus for the topic. (As always, once you read a problem, take some time to attempt it yourself, if you need help, take a peek at the "Hint" section, then again attempt to solve it yourself, feel free to check the "Answer" section if you want to check the answer you found, or even just get a feel for the magnitude of the answer.)

## Center-ing on the center

This puzzle is an extension of the Varignon parallelogram, the goal is to prove all of the following:

- The lines joining the midpoints of the opposite sides of a quadrilateral are called the bimedians of the quadrilateral. Consider the intersection point of these two lines.
 - Prove that this point is also the midpoint of the bimedians.
- Consider the line joining the centers of the diagonals of the quadrilateral.
 - Prove that this line and the bimedians above are concurrent, i.e., all three of them intersect at a single point.
 - Also prove that this point is the midpoint of the line joining the midpoints of the diagonals.

Put succinctly,   
**Q1.** Prove that the segments joining the midpoints of pairs of opposite sides of a quadrilateral and the segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals are concurrent and bisect one another.

## Generalize Varignon & Wittenbauer 

**Q2.** What is the area of the Wittenbauer parallelogram? 

What if we divide each side of a quadrilateral into k parts, and then connect the points that are \\( i\\) parts away \\( i \leq \lfloor \displaystyle \frac{k}{2} \rfloor \\) from the vertices with lines. What figure do we get? That should be easy to guess, since this is a session on parallelograms. In general, what is the area of these generalized parallelograms relative to the original quadrilateral?

## Quad by Angle Bisectors

**Q3.** Suppose we take a parallelogram and draw the angle bisector of each of its angles. 

- What can we say about the angle bisectors of opposite angles?
- What figure gets formed by the intersection points of the angle bisectors?
- If the original parallelogram had sides \\( a \\) and \\( b\\) and angke \\( \alpha \\), then what is the area of this figure in terms of these quantities?

{{< expand "Hint #1" >}}
Just draw one pair of angle bisectors to see what may be happening:
{{< columns "10,80,10" >}}
<--->
{{< figure src="images/Hint-1.png" class="figs" title="" >}}
<--->
{{< /columns >}}
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Hint #2" >}}
Well, draw the second pair of angle bisectors next:
{{< columns "10,80,10" >}}
<--->
{{< figure src="images/Hint-2.png" class="figs" title="" >}}
<--->
{{< /columns >}}
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Hint #3" >}}
The shape should be fairly clear from this picture:
{{< columns "10,80,10" >}}
<--->
{{< figure src="images/Hint-3.png" class="figs" title="" >}}
<--->
{{< /columns >}}
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Hint #4" >}}
What can you say about the two triangles shown here?
{{< columns "10,80,10" >}}
<--->
{{< figure src="images/Hint-4.png" class="figs" title="" >}}
<--->
{{< /columns >}}
And hence what can you say about the sides of the figure in the middle?
