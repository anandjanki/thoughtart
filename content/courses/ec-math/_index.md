Extra-curricular and Mathematics don’t often go hand in hand, but a series of sessions on Mathematics topics that are not generally part of regular school curriculum could be called that! 

The goal of these sessions will be to go beyond rote learning for sure:

- The aim will not be to learn a few theorems and then solve back-to-back problems at break-neck speeds.
- The goal will be to understand little concepts in great detail. We will try to find different ways to look at the same concept, and the beauty in each of those perspectives.
- We will build intuition for problem solving, but be grounded in reason. Every next step will need to be supported by every previous step that we have taken, by pure reason.
- In the process, we will hopefully learn how mathematicians think.
- The foremost goal is to have fun with Math, the sessions will almost border on relaxing time pass, much like sitting in the evening and enjoying oneself, listening to good music.

The EC Math course details are as follows:

- Any child in 8<sup>th</sup> – 10<sup>th</sup> with some reasonable aptitude in Math but more importantly interest in it should be able to go through this course.
- The areas that we will cover broadly include - Number Theory, Combinatorics, Algebra and Geometry. 
- Note that many of the topics here are not regular topics in typical 10<sup>th</sup> / 12<sup>th</sup> board exams or even most engineering entrance exams.
- There will be a few books that we can use once we reach more advanced stages, but until then we will simply use session notes here.
- Most of the initial sessions will be devoid of any problems solving, will be simply read and enjoy lessons. Note that this is the primary goal of this course. Problem solving will be introduced much later, and is only a secondary goal of the course.

Links to session notes from each topic follow.
