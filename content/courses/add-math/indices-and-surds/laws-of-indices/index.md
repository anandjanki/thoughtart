First we revisit the definition of exponentiation \\( a^m \\)

Next, we understand the most basic law $$a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n} $$

Next we see how this helps us in calculating \\( 2^{100} \\)

Next we understand the intutuin behind \\( a^{-m} \\)

Multiplication in one way is division in the other way.

Then we move on rational powers and understand \\( a^{\frac{1}{m}} \\)

And then we are ready to work on surds... :)
